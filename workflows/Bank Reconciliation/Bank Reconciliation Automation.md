**Workflow:** Mike Murphy LLC Bank Reconciliation  
**Bank Statement:** Truist Business Checking (Debit/Credit Card attached)  
**Invoice & Accounting Software:** FreshBooks  
**Other Financial Services:** PayPal  
**Invoice Payments:** Stripe  
  
**Note:** Bank transactions do not automatically import to FreshBooks. I manually add expenses & payments into FreshBooks.  
  
**Typical Monthly Reconciliation Workflow:**

1. On the 5th of every month I get an Apple Reminder to Reconcile 
2. I sign into Truist Business Account & Download PDF Statement
3. I sign into Google Adsense & check YouTube Monthly Payment and add as Other Income in FreshBooks and add the total YouTube Payment in my Accountant Google Sheet.
4. I sign into FreshBooks and open Expenses
5. I open Truist Checking PDF next to FreshBooks Window
6. I look at every expense on Truist Statement and try to match it with Expense I either manually imported or recurring expense that is automatic expensed each month
7. If expense on Truist statement is different than on FreshBooks, I edit amount to match on FreshBooks
8. I add expenses that are on statement but missing in FreshBooks and go through one by one until the Truist statement matches FreshBooks expenses
9. I then look at Truist Deposits (YouTube, Affiliates) and match with Other Income or add to FreshBooks if missing.
10. I then go to FreshBooks Reports and then run Profit & Loss Report for current month
11. I open my one-page Google Sheet from my accountant and add Income and then add the expenses in the categories on my Google Sheet until the month is reconciled.

**Goals:**
Reconciliation Process is fully automated in n8n and my Google Sheet gets automatically updated each month. I get notified of progress and issues.  
  
**Possible Product:  
My accountant/bookkeeper has over 2000 solo and small business owners as tax prep clients and if this system gets automated it’s possible I could monetize.
