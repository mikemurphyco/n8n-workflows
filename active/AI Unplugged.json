According to the Future of the Creator Economy Report 2025 published by Epidemic Sound, 91% of content creators now use AI in their workflows. Epidemic Sound’s co-founder and CEO Oscar Höglund said in the podcast interview that Adapt was built to support creators. “We do not want to be part of a narrative where we unleash huge amounts of generative AI music to flood the world and diminish the value of music made by incredibly talented artists,” he said. “The idea behind Adapt was to put those tools in the hands of creators so they can make those decisions immediately.”",

Every Sora user can upload their cameo when they make an account and choose whether to let other people use their likeness in AI videos. Sora's cameo ability to \"deepfake\" anyone who allows their likeness to be used is on a whole new level -- you can't use Meta AI or Adobe Firefly to make a video of their CEOs saying nearly anything, for example. The Sora app highlights how controversial AI media generation tools like image and video generators are among creators.",
